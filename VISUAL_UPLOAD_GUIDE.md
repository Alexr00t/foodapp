# 📸 Visual GitHub Upload Guide

## What to Look For:

### After Creating Repository:
1. **Look for this text on the repository page:**
   ```
   "…or create a new repository on the command line"
   "or upload an existing file"  ← CLICK THIS
   ```

### Alternative Method:
1. **Look for a green "Add file" button** (top right of file list)
2. **Click the dropdown arrow** next to "Add file"
3. **Select "Upload files"**

### What You Should See:
- A drag-and-drop area
- Text saying "Drag files here to upload"
- Or "choose your files" button

## 📁 Files to Upload:
Upload ALL these files from your `deploy/` folder:
- ✅ index.html
- ✅ app.js  
- ✅ style.css
- ✅ favicon.ico
- ✅ README.md
- ✅ All .json files (products.json, restaurants.json, etc.)

## 🚨 Common Issues:

**"I don't see upload option"**
- Make sure you created the repository first
- Look for "uploading an existing file" link
- Or look for "Add file" → "Upload files"

**"Files won't upload"**
- Try uploading one file at a time
- Make sure files aren't too large
- Check your internet connection

**"Repository not found"**
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Check the repository name is exactly "foodapp"
- Make sure it's set to "Public"
